# An introduction to git

Hello everyone :wave:

This repository contains my presentation for "An introduction to git" talk of the
AIDD Project's ([Advanced Machine Learning for Innovative Drug Discovery](https:/ai-dd.eu))
School in March 2024.

### "That's not a power-point presentation Andreas?!?"

I presented this talk using a tool I wrote: [terminalpoint](https://github.com/ap--/terminalpoint).
It's supposed to look like this:

it on this file:

```bash
$ pipx install terminalpoint
$ terminalpoint git-2024-03-22.tpt.md
```
